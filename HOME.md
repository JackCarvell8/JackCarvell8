Hello! I am Jack, 15, and a student from the UK!

## I am a hobby racer and racing enthusiast!
- I enjoy watching Formula racing (F1-F4) with the exeption of FE (Formula Electric)
-  In my free time I can often be found at go-karting track across the country
- I also enjoy diving as well as swimming!

## My Education

I have been in education from a young age, and am planning on staying in education for enough time to finish a degree course. For high-school I chose to study Computer Science, Geographhy and religious studies along with core subjects such as English, Maths and Science. I am planning to go to college for a BTEC in Computer and Cyber Security, where I later hope to go on a scholarship abroad for university.

## My Aspirations

For a long time now, I have aspired to go to college and university, but until recently my path beyond that has been unclear, until now. I have begun to aspire to get a job in comuting in Germany, especially in the automotive industry. This is as I have a great passion for cars and it is impossible to beat German engineering and innovation. I also aspire to own many different cars including but not limited to: the Porsche 918 Spyder, BMW E30, Aston-Martain Vantage and even an F1 show car for the low cost of Â£250,000+

## My Skills

A hobby in racing has gave me a fair few skills, and I shall list them to the best of my ability
- Adapting to situations
Racing with other drivers, from friends to competitive teams has taught me how to react in different settings with adapability
- Social Skills
When I got into my hobbies, it brought me together with many people who had the same hobbies, and this helped me gain the ability to engage in conversation more fluently
